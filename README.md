# UGC-Pipeline

*NOTE: You must already have Roblox studio and blender installed on your system before using this pipeline, the rest of the models are automatically downloaded when running the pipeline.*

##

This project aims to enable users automate the following steps of UGC **(Roblox 3D user generated content)** creation: 
- Text/Image Input → Text2Image Generation → 3D Model Generation (TripoSR) → Blender Processing → Roblox-Ready FBX

This is a Roblox UGC pipeline that I've created so that ugc creation can be more accessible to all roblox players.

## Instructions
Here are some brief instructions on how to use this in addition to roblox studio so that you can end up creating your own roblox hats too: 
- Open Studio → Import FBX → run AFT → Generate Accessory → Publish
