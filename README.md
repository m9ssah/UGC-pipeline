(NOT FINISHED, UPDATE AS U PROGRESS THRU PROJ)

This is a Roblox UGC (User Generated Content) pipeline that I've created so that ugc creation can be more accessible to all roblox players.

NOTE: You must already have Roblox studio and blender installed on your system before using this pipeline, the rest of the models are automatically downloaded when running the pipeline.


Here are some brief instructions on how to use this in addition to roblox studio so that you can end up creating your own roblox hats too:
Open Studio → Import FBX → run AFT → Generate Accessory → Publish
